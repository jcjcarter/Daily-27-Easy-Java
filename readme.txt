Write a program that accepts a year as input and outputs the century the year belongs in (e.g. 18th century's year
ranges are 1701 to 1800) and whether or not the year is a leap year. Pseudocode for leap year can be found here.
Sample run:
Enter Year: 1996
Century: 20
Leap Year: Yes
Enter Year: 1900
Century: 19
Leap Year: No
